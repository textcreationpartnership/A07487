            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Two examples then (moſt noble Prince) haue ſtirred me vp to this aduenture; the one of <hi>Syneta,</hi> preſenting an handfull of water to that great King <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> as before; the other of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> to the Athenians. <hi>Diogenes,</hi> a man not inferior to <hi>Plato,</hi> in age and ſect, ſeeing all the Athenians buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in rampiring &amp; defencing their wals for feare of their enemies, and himſelfe not called to the ſame worke, becauſe a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher and ſtranger; leaſt in the common buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of all, he alone ſhould be counted an idle ſpectator, began to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>umble and toſſe his tun vp and downe, that he might thereby teſtifie (being all he could doe) his readineſſe to helpe the Athenians, if they pleaſed to vſe his labour. This thing the Athennians ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
<pb facs="tcp:4714:7"/>praiſed, and committed to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all memorie. Wherein two duties were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly well performed. For it was the part of a good man, albeit a ſtranger (as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> was) to ioyne his care to the common care of the inhabitants, and plainly to ſhew himſelfe as readie, as others of that place, to defend the common good; and this did <hi>Diogenes:</hi> it was alſo the part of noble, wiſe, and thankfull Citizens, to approue and not deſpiſe the good minde of that man, whoſe labour they vſed not in defence of their countrie rights; and this did the Athenians. My ſelfe, by both theſe examples being war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of my dutie, and truſting to the moſt high equitie of your noble diſpoſition, and like comitie and noble acceptance, as the Perſian King ſhewed to the poore <hi>Syneta</hi> (not eſtimating the mind by the gift, but the gift by the minde; for (as <hi>Bernard</hi>) the true value of a benefit is the good wil of the mind) haue not doubted dutifully to offer and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe my labour and ſeruice (ſuch as it is) in the common labour and care of your crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and moſt obliged ſeruants, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of your honour and increaſe of your future happineſſe.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt then, that thou maieſt meditate profitably of Death: put thy ſelfe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the ſight of God, who beholdes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4714:10"/>thee in all thy actions; and begge of him thus preſent, that al thy thoughts, words, workes, and all thy ſtrength may wholly be directed to his glorie and thy ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And here firſt conceiue thy ſelfe to be lying vpon thy bed, neere vnto death, the Phyſicions deſpairing of thy health, and thy friends ſorrowing for thy depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the ſoule being now readie to giue the laſt gaſpe. Secondly, entreate God with hartie affections, to giue thee grace that thou maiſt take profit by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt point here to be meditated, is, that death is ineuitable and certaine, the houre of death moſt vncertain, the place and manner of death vnknowne: and that this is the common lot and portion of all men, of what degree or condition ſoeuer. Therefore it is extreme madneſſe for men, knowing theſe things, to liue ſo ſecurely as they do, building vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues I know not what Imaginarie Worlds, and Caſtles in the Aire, as if all were but fables that are written of death; when in the meane time death ſuddenly ſeiſeth vpon them, vnthought on, and vnprepared for his ſtroke, which vnto many is the cauſe of eternall damnation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:4714:10"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond to bee conſidered, is, that in death by little and little, the ſpeech and all the powers of the ſenſes are loſt. Nor when thou commeſt to this ſtraight, ſhalt thou vnderſtand or know any man any more: not canſt thou remooue thy ſelfe from this bedde of death, in which thou lieſt, left of all, ſeeing Friends nor Phyſitions, nor any other can helpe thee: nor gold and ſiluer, or nobilitie, or that great expectation and eſtimation that all men had of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee, ſhall profit thee. Thy vnderſtanding, by the ſtrength of griefe and ſickneſſe ſhalbe obſcured, thy memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie blurred, and thou ſo aſtoniſhed and ſenſeleſſe, that thou ſhalt not know in what place and what caſe thou lieſt; and with much difficultie ſhalt thou be ſtirred vp to any ſenſe or ſorrow for thy ſinne.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>This conſideration will not a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh thee, that thou ſhalt haue at that time, more then euer in all thy life, more doubts and ſcares ſuggeſted thee of the certaintie of thy ſaluation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſt, in reſpect of the multitude of thy ſinnes; ſecondly, in that thou ſhalt then haue the memory of thy ſinnes repreſented to thee, which obliuion and cuſtome of ſinning had ſtolne from thee; thirdly in that the ſins;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4714:11"/>which then thou thoughteſt to bee little and light, doe now appeare great and grieuous; fourthly, in that thy repentance (dying) is not ſo ſecure, as when thou art in health. Hence it will fall out, that thou ſhalt bee ſo amazed, that thou wilt not know which way to turne thee. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne backe, the grieuouſnes of thy ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will not ſuffer thee: To goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is of all fearefull thinges the moſt fearefull. To ſtand ſtill in that eſtate God will not ſuffer, who hath numbred all thy dayes from eternitie, and will haue this to bee the laſt houre of thy life. If thou beholdeſt God, hee will appeare to thee, angrie, with the ſword of his moſt iuſt vengeance, drawne againſt thee for thy impenitent life: If thou caſt downe thy eyes, thou ſhalt ſee nothing but a ſtinking graue for thy bodie, which thou ſo much louedſt and pamperedſt; and the gates of Hel ſtanding open, to entertaine thy ſoule which in thy life thou ſo little regardedſt. If thou enter into thy ſelfe; what ſhalt thou finde, but a confuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite maſſe of thy ſinnes? the conſcience whereof doth worthily adiudge thee to eternall torments.

                  </head>
                  <p>THis Meditation muſt take his riſe from a preparatiue Prayer as in the former; in which wee muſt firſt propoſe to our ſelues a moſt vaſt, and bottomleſſe gulfe, hideous to behold; in darkneſſe, moſt dungeon-like; in paines and torments moſt horrible; in ſmel moſt odious; as it were a Sea brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out flames and ſmoke; whereof we may repreſent to our imagination a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, by calling to minde that horrible mountaine of <hi>Aetna</hi> in Sicilia, and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuvius in Naples; both which belch out the inward bowels of the Earth with ſtones, flames, fumes, and aſhes; and that in ſuch ſurie, as if it imitated the Giants warre, and meant to ouerthrow the God of Heauen, and all his Saints, to draw the Sunne downe to the Earth, and turne the night into day. The burning aſhes of this helliſh Veſuvius (as <hi>Dion Caſsius</hi> notes) in the time of <hi>Titus</hi> his Empire, were not onely carried to Rome, but to Affrica and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when in the boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Seas fiſhes were boyled to death; in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:4714:17"/>the Aier, birds choked with ſmoke; and the moſt famous and ancient neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Cities, Stabea, Herculeanum, and Pompeij, were ouerwhelmed with ſtones and aſhes, whileſt the people ſat in the Theater. Now conceiue the horrour and hideouſneſſe of Hell far to exceed all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and deſcriptions that can bee made thereof: but if any thing can in part ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the forme of it; then may this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Natures horrour doe it. Secondly Beg on the knees of thy heart, that God would ſo bleſſe thy meditation, that the horrour of the place, and the intermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and endleſſe puniſhments and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ſinne to bee inflicted vpon the damned, may make ſuch an impreſſion in thy inward man, that hence thou maiſt bee ſtrengthned by his grace, to ſhunne and hate all manner of ſinne, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience againſt Gods Law; but ſpecially, that it may quench in thee, and vtterly extinguiſh the heat of luſt, that moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in-bred enemie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt point here to bee conſidered, is; that this fire, into which the damned and vnhappie ſoules are caſt, and with which tormented, is without all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of time, or puniſhment, with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4714:17"/>ſuch acerbitie and varietie of torments, as cannot beconceiued, much leſſe vttered, in a place horrible, full of filth, ſqualour, horrour &amp; hideouſneſſe, where there is no order, but eternall horrour euer dwelleth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Behold thoſe fearefull, horrid, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing blaſphemies, into which thoſe moſt vnhappie ſoules breake out againſt God, as an enemie; againſt Chriſt, as a Iudge; againſt the Saintes, as partiall. Here contemplate the execrations and curſes of Fathers againſt their Children, in that for the loue of them they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into this irrecouerable perdition; of ſonnes againſt their fathers, in that by their too much indulgence they haue caſt them into theſe vnſufferable flames: there the friends and companions amongſt themſelues will rayle and curſe, and like dogs one teare another, in that the one hath by wicked examples and counſailes ſeduced the other, and haue not rebuked them for their ſinnes, nor laboured to ſtay them from the courſes that led them to that damnation. And this ſhall be with ſuch tumult and noiſe, that if any ſuch thing could now be heard of vs, it would depriue vs of all our ſenſes, and ſtrike vs as dead as ſtones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:4714:18"/>A third point conſiderable, is; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how this infinite Armie of damned and reprobates, buried in madneſſe and hatred, obſtinate in frenzie, lie amongſt Serpents, Dragons, Baſiliskes, and other monſters; euer compaſſed about with the horrible formes of diuels, who with a perpetuall hatred againſt the damned, that are deliuered ouer to their power, do heape puniſhment vpon puniſhment, and ſorrow vpon ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, conſider that albeit there are innumerable kindes of torments inflicted vpon the damned; yet two (aboue the reſt) are chiefely to be weighed. The firſt is <hi>poena ſenſus,</hi> the puniſhment of their ſenſes. For the Soule, being in her nature moſt noble, ſhall for euer be tortured with moſt exquiſite and grieuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: the Imagination can conceiue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but flames, wherewith for euer it is burned: the Memorie retaine nothing but the thought of thoſe ſinnes for which it is ſo tormented; ſeeing they ſhall not carry that viſage which now they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnto vs, but as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; a ſhape, more horrible then Hell it ſelfe. The conceit of which horrour of ſinnes was ſuch, as moued good <hi>Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:4714:18"/>to ſay, That he had rather (if it were poſſible) goe into Hell eternally without ſinne, then to dwell in Heauen for euer with ſin. The vnderſtanding ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, that it ſhal be able to comprehend nothing, but that which ſhall increaſe the ſorrow. Now, what griefe ſhall that be (O wretched man) which thou ſhalt feele, when thou thy ſelfe being the moſt vnhappie betrayer of thy ſelfe, ſhalt be forced to frie in the furnace of ſuch flames? O miſerable eyes and eares, which for the moſt filthy things in which thou tookeſt pleaſures, ſhall inherite no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but howlings, roarings, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies! O miſerable Carcaſſe, which for the delectation of thy ſenſes, ſhalt for euer bee tormented with intolerable paines. Behold now, if euery little ſorrow and paine, that is but ſhort, ſeeme to thee intolerable, what wilt thou then doe in ſuch an Ocean of calamities and torments as no mortall man is able to conceiue. Secondly, the other puniſhment is <hi>poena Damni,</hi> the puniſhment of loſſe; much more grieuous then the other: ſeeing this is the depriuation of the bleſſed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and face of God, from which the damned are vtterly hatred; being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4714:19"/>ſo inexplicable, that the bleſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cannot vtter it but thus;<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that loue him.</hi> Nor is there any power of the minde, which, if it ſhould thinke from the beginning of the world to the end thereof, could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any thing of the ioy or fruition of God, but that the thing it ſelfe would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely exceed the cogitation and conceit of it: and this for euer the damned doe want. On the other ſide to be ſecluded from the preſence of God, is of all miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the greateſt miſerie; inſomuch that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, Many do abhorre Hell: but I eſteeme the fall from that glory, to be a greater puniſhment then Hell it ſelfe; yea though any man ſhould propoſe vnto me a thouſand hels, yet ſhall he ſay no ſuch thing vnto me, as to fall from that glorie, to bee hated of Chriſt, and to heare that ſoule-killing word, <hi>Non nouivos,</hi> I know you not. For it is better to ſuſtaine tenne thouſand thunder-claps, then to ſee that bleſſed face turned from vs, and that life-giuing eye not enduring to ſee vs.</p>

Tenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Strength, what is it? ſeeing the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thinges, and thoſe moſt worthie of a man, are not done by the ſtrength of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, but by the ſinnewes of wit; Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and Strength being but the flowers of the body, which one blaſt of a feuer wil deface, and ſhake all to fitters. Eleuenth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Pleaſures of the body are but as the body it ſelfe is, pecudine and vile: Diſeaſes are the vſurie of pleaſures, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſorrow, the bond. Hence it is ſaid, That when <hi>Iupiter</hi> could not accord Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Sorrow in a difference that they

               <head>3 Of the pleaſures of the bodie.</head>
               <p n="1">1 PLeaſures of the bodie, the beaſts do more often<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, &amp; lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger enioy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Beſides, hence do ariſe, Firſt, many diſeaſes of the bodie, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, much loſſe of ſubſtance, Thirdly, much repentance to the minde; Fourthly, much dulneſſe of wit, and decaie of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ſoule, Fiftly impatience of a mans ſelfe, Sixtly, hatred of all Vertues. Beſides, no man is ſo impudent that dare vſe them publikely for ſhame, but ſeekes darkneſſe to take his pleaſures in. They are alſo moſt flitting, and vncertaine, and euer mixt with bitterneſſe. Therefore the greateſt euill is not (as the Vulgar thinke) Pouertie, Ignobilitie, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Ignominie, Deformitie, Sickneſſe Imbecilitie: but Vices, and thoſe thinges
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4714:28"/>that are next to Vices, Ignorance, Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, Madneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 God did not create vs to play, and trifle out the time, but to ſerious thinges, to Moderation, Modeſtie, Temperance, Religion, and all Vertues. Therefore let vs not cure the diſeaſes of the bodie, with the ſickneſſes of the ſoule.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Conſider how great an euill it is to rule wicked men; but how much greater, if thou be wicked thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Man muſt keep his minde (the inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed preciouſneſſe that makes him man) as Cleanlineſſe keepes white; or rather as Virginitie keepes Virginitie. For a ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned minde blemiſheth the whole bodie.</p>
               <p n="5">5 No man can be iuſt to himſelfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wertue: for Affection, being a groſſe and partiall chooſer, will ſtarue the mind to feed the ſenſes: and oftentimes ſtarues ſome of the ſenſes themſelues, to glut o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Therefore, to the end that bodily pleaſures doe not infatuare vs, we muſt by vertue curbe affection, the breeder of pleaſures. So that to be iuſt, we muſt be vertuous; to be wiſe, we muſt be vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; to be good, we muſt be vertuous; to be honeſt, we muſt be vertuous; nay to bee, we muſt be vertuous. For to bee vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4714:28"/>and ſenſuall, is but baſe corruption, which killes and deformes, and cannot be ſeene after her conqueſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Pleaſure and profit, are the two bodies which man labours to adorne; and what is Pleaſure but the adulterate Brat of the Senſes? Are not our Senſes the Counſellers and perſwaders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them? and yet how baſe a Counſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is the whole earth to direct him, for whom Heauen and Earth were made? For pleaſures are no ſooner borne, but they die; no ſooner ſeene, but they ſhrink away for ſhame. And who euer ſaw it otherwiſe, but that either the body or the conſcience vomited out the ſurfets of pleaſure? the licoriſh entertainers of them being plagued with more thirſt and vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorie taſtes, to be rid of them, then they were before with famine, to enioy them.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Two things informe vs, that there is no true excellencie in any of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the bodie, but that Opinion hath ſeduced Imagination ſo to beleeue. The one is, that he who giues vs both them and our ſelues, hath barred himſelfe of them; which he would not doe if they were ſuch excellent bleſſings. The other, that they are ſo fading, they would not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4714:29"/>laſt while their pictures are a drawing, if memorie did not preſerue them.</p>
               <p n="8">8 There is nothing in Pleaſure that can make it valuable: if anything, then is it eyther profit or pleaſure: Profit there is none, if profit be that which is laſting and excellent. What laſting is that, which is at the longeſt but an Ephemerides, or of one daies age? and what excellencie is that, which the moſt excellent doe abhorre and diſcard? If we look for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in pleaſure, ſhe deceiues vs with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and ſhadowes. For the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and ſhewing of her teeth in her contentments, is the beſt ſhe affords vs, whileſt the heart is loaden and pierced through with the ſtaines of ſinne, and ſting of guilt.</p>
               <p n="9">9 To pleaſe the bodie, and put the minde to drudgerie for his ſake, is as full of peril as folly; and no other good comes thereof, but a diſ-ranking of all good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, of Holineſſe, putting the Cart before the Horſe, Earth before Heauen. Pleaſures of the bodie are the diſeaſes of the bodie, and no more to be followed or beleeued, then the conceits of a man in a burning feauer.</p>
               <p n="10">10 You will beleeue that a veſſell full
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4714:29"/>of chinkes and holes, holds nothing to the good of the owner: why will ye not then iudge, that a bodie and minde, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with chinkes and holes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, powres out it ſelfe vnprofitably, and ſpends faſter then it gets? all their actions being monſters, ſome wanting heads, ſome feete, one blinde, another deafe, and none with right ſhape or Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. With this, caſt vp your gaines and loſſes, the ſhortneſſe of them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafetie, and torments of them; and tell me if any, but fooles and mad men, will make choice of ſuch companions.</p>

               <p n="1">1 THou muſt not only bee deare to thy ſelfe, but alſo venerable; ſo that thou ſhalt bee aſhamed of thy ſelfe, if thou ſhalt doe any thing fooliſhly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently, flagitiouſly, wickedly, nefari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and impiouſly; euen as if done vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Theater of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Make more account of the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of thy conſcience, then of the voice of an infinite multitude; which is fooliſh and ignorant, and as it raſhly approues vnknowne things, ſo it condemnes them as ſoone.</p>
               <p n="3">3 A troubled conſcience bringes the greateſt torment to the ſoule, that can be in the World; a quiet conſcience, the greateſt bliſſe: no riches, no kingdome, to be compared to it.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:4714:35"/>4 Fame ſhall neuer profit a wicked man, nor hurt a good man.</p>
               <p n="5">5 When one is dead; what ſhal hee haue more from fame, then <hi>Apelles</hi> his picture when it is praiſed, or the horſe that ouercame in Olympus games? nor yet will it profit him being aliue, if hee know it not; and if he know it, it brings him no more benefit but this; That, as a wiſeman, hee may contemne it; and, as a foole, hee may pleaſe himſelfe for it.</p>
               <p n="6">6 But the conſcience is a ſolid and perdurable teſtimonie, of much force in that terrible day of iudgement: and the Myſtreſſe of this preſent life, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether corrupted by the affections: It is the braze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wal of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in God alone, which cannot bee moued or demoliſhed.</p>
               <p n="7">7 It is a diſgracefull thing to bee knowne to others, and vnknowne to thy ſelfe; doth it not ſuffice thee to be known to thy ſelfe, and chiefly to God? wouldeſt thou haue a more repleniſhed Theater? or a name more laſting.</p>
               <p n="8">8 To loue thy ſelfe, is to labour by moſt earneſt prayer with God, that thy moſt excellent part, the Minde, may bee decked with true ornaments of vertue, but chiefly with Religion.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:4714:36"/>9 For he loues not himſelfe that loues riches, honours, pleaſures, or any thing without himſelfe, or in the bodie; ſeing the principall part is the Minde: nor doth he loue himſelfe, that by ignorance of himſelfe deceiues himſelfe, or ſuffers himſelfe of others to bee deceiued: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading himſelfe there are worthie thinges in him, when there are none.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The blinde and inconſiderate loue of the bodie is the ſource of all euils: for it takes away Charitie; whence all euil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth in the World. Hee that too much loues himſelfe thus, neither loues him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, nor is truly beloued of others.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Remember, that if thou thinkeſt thoſe things which ſerue thee by nature, to bee at thy libertie and vnreſtrained, and ſhalt take other mens for thine own, it ſhall come to paſſe that thou ſhalt bee hindred, troubled, lament, and accuſe both God and man: but if thou thinkeſt that to be thine, which indeede is thine, and other mens (as they are) to be other mens; no man ſhall euer hinder or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee; thou ſhalt accuſe none; thou ſhalt doe nothing vnwillingly; none ſhal hurt thee; thou ſhalt haue no enemie, nor receiue any calamitie.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:4714:36"/>12 Thoſe thinges are ours which are in our power; as Opinion, Appetite, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, Diſlike, and all our actions: thoſe are not ours; as the Bodie, Monie, Glorie, Empire, nor things which we our ſelues doe not.</p>
               <p n="13">13 In euery thing that either delights thee, or ſerues for thy vſe, or is beloued, conſider what kinde of thinges they are: beginning at the leaſt; as if thou loueſt a pot: that it is a pot, thou loueſt, for that being broken, thou wilt not be troubled: if thy ſonne or thy wife; know thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedſt a mortall Creature: for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, thou ſhalt not be grieued.</p>
               <p n="14">14 No perturbation ariſeth to man from the thinges themſelues, but from the opinions of them. Death is not euil; but the opinion is ill. Therefore when we are hindred or diſtracted, let vs not blame others but our ſelues, that is, our opinions. To accuſe others in our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, is the part of an vnwiſe man; to accuſe our ſelues, the part of him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be wiſe: but to accuſe nor others, nor our ſelues, the part of him that is wiſe indeed.</p>
               <p n="15">15 As in ſayling, if thou go on land to refreſh thy ſelfe, and gather Cockles on
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:4714:37"/>the ſhore, thou muſt haue thy eye on the ſhip, and thy eare readie to the Call of the Gouernour; that hauing called, hee weigh not anchor and leaue thee behind: ſo in this life, if inſtead of Cockles, a wiſe, childe, riches or honour, be giuen thee; theſe muſt not hinder thee, but that the Maſter calling, thou muſt runne to the ſhippe and leaue them all, not looking backe, but hauing thy minde bent vpon God.</p>

               <p n="17">17 Wee muſt ſo behaue our ſelues in this life, as in a banquet. If any thing be brought thee, with modeſtie put forth thy hand and take it. Is it gone? care not for it. Is it not come? reach not out thy appetit too far for it, til it be brought thee. If thus thou carrie thy ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wife, children, riches, Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, thou ſhalt bee worthie the banquet of God: but if, when they are brought
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4714:37"/>thee, thou deſpiſe them, thou ſhalt bee a conſort of Gods Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Remember thou art the Actor of ſuch a fable as thy Maſter approues; if ſhort, of a ſhort one; if long, of a long one. If he will haue thee play the part of a begger, or Prince, or Plebeian, ſee thou repreſent that perſon ingenuouſly. For this is thy part, to put on that perſon wel that is giuen thee: but to chooſe what part, is not thine, but anothers; euen Gods.</p>
               <p n="19">19 If thou wilt be truly free, and not bonde, contemne the thinges which are not in thy owne power.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Death, Baniſhment, and all that is accounted euill, haue daily before thy eyes; but aboue all, death: ſo ſhalt thou neuer thinke any baſe thing, no nor yet greatly deſire any thing.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Seek not that honor or place in the World, which thou canſt not attaine or keepe without wracke of integritie and godneſſe,</p>
               <p n="22">22 If thou beeſt not bidden to the ſame banquet, nor holden in the ſame Honour that others are, grieue not thy ſelfe: for as he which paies the price of the horſe, muſt haue him, and yet is

               <p n="23">23 Things that ſerue the bodie; as meat, drinke, clothing, houſes, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, let them bee ſo far miniſtred, as they are of vſe to the minde: But refuſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer belongs to Oſtentation or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>

               <p>It is a diſcourſe of very facile demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, That true religion by her actes ſeruing the diuine wiſedome, is truly the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:4714:43"/>end, and in ſome ſort the efficient, and forme of all humane felicitie, aſwell of that which conſiſts in the goods of the bodie, and externall things, as of that which conſiſts in the goods of the minde. And if any man preſume to ſay to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the ſame ſhall be found to ſpeake againſt euery part of Philoſophie and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie, againſt the decrees of all wiſe men, againſt the conſent of all Nature: And he ſhall not onely doe ſo, but alſo contradict all morall, Politicall, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and Metaphyſicall learning: he ſhall be repugnant to the writing of the moſt learned, to the ſayings of the greateſt Emperours, to the wiſeſt Sages of all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Nations, Lawyers, Phyſitions, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquaries, the moſt renowned men of all times; and euen to the euents of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdomes. And it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houe him, if he will ſpeake truth, to haue this whole world to periſh, and another order of naturall things, vnlike and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to this world that is, to be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For it will neuer appeare that true felicitie had euer any other riſe, then from true Religion. Therefore, when Religion ſhall be ſo oppreſſed, that the Sonne of Men when he comes, ſhall not find faith
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:4714:44"/>on the Earth, then ſhal this whole world periſh:<note place="margin">Luc.</note> which doth then alſo decay, and in part fall, when true Religion is in any part decayed or ſhaken. And this is that which the Lawyers ſay, That <hi>Ius ſtatus,</hi> The Law of ſtate, conſiſts (before all things) <hi>in ſacris &amp; ſacerdotibus,</hi>

               <p>Conſonant hereto is the iudgement of the wiſeſt Heathens: the chiefeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Egyptians affirming, in the perſon of God: I am preſent to them that are good,<note place="margin">Mercur. Triſ. in Poeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dro.</note> godly, pure, religious, and holy, and my prefence doth ſo helpe them, that they know all things, and haue God the father pleaſed and propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to them. On the other ſide. I dwell farre from the ſlouthfull, the ignorant, impious, the enuious, the vniuſt, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micides, giuing them ouer to the will of the Diuell, who takes vengeance of them. What can be ſpoken more diuinely, then this of that great Egyptian Sage <hi>Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus?</hi> Of the ſame iudgement, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning religion, and diuine things, that they are the onely grounds and cauſes of proſperitie and felicitie, were the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Chaldaeans, Babyionians. Elſe, why ſhould the King of Niniue, that moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient &amp; potent King,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ion.</hi> 3.7.8.9.</note> ſo diuinely order his repentance, &amp; humiliation to God vpon that only ſhort Sermon of <hi>Ionas? Yet forty dayes, and Niniue ſhalbee deſtoyed;</hi> that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4714:45"/>man and beaſt were commanded a ſolemn faſt, putting on ſackcloth, &amp; crying to the Lord, and that euery man ſhould returne from the wickednes that was in his heart, <hi>for who can tell if God will turne from his fierce wrath, that we periſh not?</hi> Had not this beene in vaine, but that they iudged, that Religion and Pietie was the cauſe of felicitie? In like ſort when Samaria was taken by <hi>Salmanaſſar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.</note> and the Iewes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away into Media and Aſſyria, the land being giuen to be inhabited vnto a people ignorant of the true worſhip of God, who were deuoured of Lyons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they feared not the Lord, did not they attribute this to the ignorance of ſeruing the true God, by which onely thing they conceiued they might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from that iudgement? But if they had not beleeued that temporall euils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall the wicked from God, and temporall good things are giuen to the godly, they would neither haue done thus, nor would the euent haue anſwered their actions. The ſame things are recorded of the Chaldaeans and Babylonians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their opinion of religion in that kind. For thus an ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Hiſtorian writes. The Caldaeans being the moſt ancient of
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4714:46"/>the Babylonians,<note place="margin">Diod. Sicul.</note> did obtaine that place in the Commonwealth, which the Prieſts did in Egypt: for they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the worſhip of their Gods, phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophyzed all their life time; and were accounted moſt skilfull in Aſtrologie. Many by a certaine diuination fore-told things to come, and as well by auguries and ſacred things, as by ceraine other ſignes, were wont to interprete both euil auguries, diuinations, and coniectures, to be diſturned from men, and good ones to befall other men: which thing we ſee more plainly deliuered by the diuine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. For when <hi>Nabuzaradon,</hi> the chiefe Steward to <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 40.2.</note> had ſet the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> at libertie, he ſpake thus vnto him, The Lord thy God hath pronounced this plague vpon this place: now the Lord hath brought it, and done according as hee hath ſaid: becauſe ye haue ſinned againſe the Lord, and haue not obeyed his voyce, therfore this thing is come vpon you. So we ſee, he iudged that temporall puniſhments were infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vpon men &amp; Nations for their ſins. Beſides, the Kings of the Aſſyrians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans, and Perſians, were alſo Prieſtes, nor could they obtaine the Kingdome,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4714:46"/>except they had beene of the companie of their <hi>Magi,</hi> who were Prieſts, and inſtructed in their learning: for <hi>Nemo regnare poteſt, niſi inter Magos ſit iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philo.</note> No man could raigne there, vnleſſe he were iudged to be amongſt their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi</hi> or Prieſt. Whereby they gaue to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in Religion and Pietie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the felicitie of Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. And <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,<note place="margin">Cl. Alex. l. <hi>7</hi>
                  </note> that it was the cuſtome amongſt all the learned Nations, that hee who ſhould be King, muſt alſo be a Prieſt: ſo much they iudged religion to import the felicitie of Kingdomes. Hence it is that <hi>Xenophon</hi> writes,<note place="margin">Xenop. <hi>8.</hi> Paed.</note> that the Perſians accounted them moſt happy, that were moſt godly, but the ſocietie of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious to be moſt vnhappy. If we deſcend to the Grecians we ſhall find them all of one iudgement in this point, namely, that all felicitie depends vpon pietie. <hi>Plato,</hi> whom they call the God of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, in many places ſhewes, That by Prudence &amp; Goodneſſe men are brought to beatitude and happineſſe: without which prudence and piety no good thing can befall men, but all good bleſſings are turned vnto euill. And therefore in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4714:47"/>the end of that moſt ſweete and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Dialogue, which he frameth betwixt <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> he concludeth, <hi>Nemo foelixeſſe poteſt, niſi ſapiens bonuſ<expan>

And the wiſe (ſaith he) do deliuer, that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Earth, the Gods and Men, are knit together in a certaine ſocietie and friendſhip, and with a modeſt or nature, temperance, and iuſtice. To ſpend no more time amongſt the Grecians, whoſe ſayings are to this end infinite, let vs conclude with the Romans, the wiſeſt, happieſt, &amp; moſt flouriſhing Empire of all others. <hi>Cicero,</hi> the Prince of Orators, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth it thus:<note place="margin">Cic. Orat. de Aruſp.</note> How deſirous are we to be in a nored of our ſelues (Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript) &amp; yet neyther haue we ouercome
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:4714:47"/>the Spaniards with numbers, nor the french with ſtrength, nor the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with craft, nor the Greeks with Arts, nor (to conclude) with the domeſtique or nariue ſenſe of this ayre and earth, the Italians and Latines, but with piety and religion, and by this onely wiſedome, that wee haue acknowledged that all things are ruled and gouerned by the power of the immortall Gods: by this onely haue we vanquiſhed all Nations and Countries. So then I will cloſe this diſcourſe with the authoritie of a graue writer,<note place="margin">Dion. Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. l. 2. de Rom.</note> concerning <hi>Romulus</hi> his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Romane Re-publique. When <hi>Romulus</hi> (ſaith he) had obſerued, that there were certaine cauſes of the felicity of Weale-publiques, vpon which it was vulgarly agreed, but yet granted but to a few to attaine vnto them; Firſt, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the diuine powers, which being preſent all things doe proſperouſly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Secondly, temperance, hand in hand with iuſtice, by which two it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that men hurt themſelues leſſe, mutually conſent together the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and doe not meaſure felicitie by their filthy pleaſure, but by honeſtly, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and laſtly military valour, by whoſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4714:48"/>helpe other vertues ſubſiſt, he did not ſuppoſe that any of theſe good things came of their owne accord, but vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that a Citie was made godly, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, iuſt and ſtrong in battell, by right lawes, and emulation of honeſt ſtudies, Therfore he gaue great diligence chiefely to theſe things, enterpriſing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing all his actions, before all things, from the worſhip of the Gods, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Citizens to thinke or ſpeake any thing but well and excellently of that diuine and bleſſed nature. The ſame Author ſaith, that all men, to whom the pietie of the Romans was vnknown, may ceaſe to admire of their happy ſucceſſe in watres, ſeeing they neuer tooke armes but vpon moſt iuſt cauſes, which thing did chiefly procure to them the fauour of the Gods. So that it is moſt euident, that all Nations with ful conſent haue deereed this truth, that all felicitie and happineſſe, temporall &amp; eternall, hath his dependa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; root from Vertue, Religion, and Pietie. Therefore the Ciuilians teach, that the firſt precept of the Law of Nations,<note place="margin">Pompon.</note> was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion towards God, the ſecond obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to parents &amp; country, the third defence of our ſelf &amp; ours, the fourth, not to inſidiate
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4714:48"/>or lie in wait, and beguile another. From whence wee collect, that all deceits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, and death it ſelfe, is to be ſuffered for religions ſake, our Parents, &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: but together with life, Countrie, and Parents, all thinges are to be eſteemed of no worth, in reſpect of our Religion and Dutie to GOD; and that is the firſt precept of the Lawe of Nations. Beſides, the ſame Ciuilians teſtifie,<note place="margin">Vlpian.</note> That publike Law conſiſts in Sacred thinges Sacred perſons, and Magiſtrates; ſo that <hi>Ius ſtatus,</hi> the Law of ſtate or ſtanding, as the Politicians cal it, hath his life from Sacred thinges and perſons: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Common-wealth ruines, and cannot ſtand, (for hence is it called <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) without Sacred thinges and perſons. And this is it that <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeakes: Pietie is the foundation of all vertues; which pietie towardes God being taken away, faith, and ſocietie of Mankinde, and that one moſt excellent Vertue, Iuſtice, muſt needes alſo faile. Hence the ſame Author perſwades,<note place="margin">Cicero de leg. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> Let this from the beginning of all men bee beleeued, that the Gods are the Lords and Moderatours of all thinges; and that the thinges which they doe, are by their power and prouidence

               <p>THE thinges that ruine Kingdomes are of two ſorts: Firſt Diume; for this World is tranſitorie, mortall, and the place of mortall thinges, ſo that no part of it, but is ſubiect to mutation.

So is it in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: for we ſee the moſt potent King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes that euer were, as that of the <hi>Chaldeans, Perſians, Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> ouerthrowne; but the chiefeſt of theſe cauſes is God himſelfe, who hath decreed to euery Kingdome his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, progreſſe, increaſe, maturitie, and death.

Theſe are the Antecedents of the Laſt times: and by how much as any Kingdome or people doe depart from true and ſincere pietie, and fal into theſe deuouring gulfes of iniquitie and impietie, by ſo much are they in danger to be ſwallowed vp, and looſe the fruition of Heauens and Earths
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4714:51"/>felicitie. For if the root of the principall good thing be ſhaken, or ſuffer any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ruine, or hurt; much more muſt all thoſe things that depend thereon. Hence is it, that the Philoſopher concludes, That chiefly Kingdomes and Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are diſſolued and changed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ariſt.

By which he concludes, That onely that Kingdome is happie, whoſe end is Vertue, and the contemplation of God. For God is happie by contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelfe, and that according to nature; of himſelfe, not by any externall acceſſorie. And ſeeing God, contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4714:52"/>himſelfe, worketh all thinges in the World; therefore hee ordaines, that by this contemplation all thinges ſhould be ruled in that Kingdome, that would haue future felicitie. Therefore herein muſt all men, people, Nations, and Kingdomes, propoſe God to be imitated, if they will haue durable and permanent happineſſe. For when they faile in this imitation, they fal into the burning feuers of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, to their vtter conſumption and ruine. Which thing the moſt potent, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent, and flouriſhing States that euer were, haue left witneſſed to vs, by their wofull ruines through exceſſe, and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. So that if wee take a ſuruey of the manners of Nations, when they gained to themſelues moſt high Empires, and Commands; and of their Conditions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes, when they were changed, ruined, and ouerthrowne; we ſhall finde, that in the beginning they were frugall, continent, ſhamefaſt, vertuous, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for morall excellencies; and on the other ſide, towardes their declining and end, intemperate, with all manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: and deſtroyed through luſt and pleaſure.

               <p n="3">3 The third is the vnſhamefaſtnes or ſhameleſnes of ſinning. Sins may be horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in nature, many in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, &amp; God may winke at them a long time: but when men ſin with a whoriſh forehead, &amp; bluſh-leſſe cheeke, God cannot haue longer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Sine vere cundia nihil rectum eſſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,<note place="margin">Cic. l. <hi>1.</hi> offic</note> nihil honeſtum:</hi> and <hi>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4714:56"/>ſolemne offices: the Miſtreſſe of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, beloued of her neighbours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of ſtrangers, in euery place and time, carrying a fauourable countenance: and <hi>Bernard,</hi> That ſpirituall ſhamfaſtnes is the glory of the conſcience, the keeper of fame, the ornament of life, the ſeat of vertues, the enſigne of nature and all goodneſſe. Now caſt backe your eye vpon thoſe grieuous ſinnes, and behold if all of them of all men be not as famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly and boldly committed, as men vſe to eate and drinke, without bluſhing or ſhame.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth is the impunitie of ſinnes. Many manifeſt and ſhameleſſe ſinnes might receiue fauourable indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from God, if they were duly puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: but the ſufferance of theſe groſſe ſinnes, and in the greateſt perſons, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxed, vnpuniſhed, drawes on Gods heauie iudgements. For if wee deferre the puniſhing of thoſe ſinnes that offend God, we prouoke his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God being much delighted in the puniſhment of wickedneſſe, which being vnpuniſhed, doth ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and obſcure his glory. How ſeldome great ſinnes, and in great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4714:57"/>are puniſhed, I need not light you a candle to ſee: <hi>Dat veniam coruis, vexat cenſura columbas:</hi> and what ſhall we ſee, if animaduerſion be vſed againſt ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, but a moſt vniuſt courſe? tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of humane Lawes to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly puniſhed: but violators of the diuine to be greatly honoured? <hi>Crimen laeſae Maieſtatis humanae, viz.</hi> traytors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings Maieſtie to be puniſhed with the ſword: but <hi>Crimen laeſae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtatis diuinae, viz.</hi> Treaſon againſt God to be vncenſured, ſo much as with a word.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The fift is the affection, ſtudie, and promptneſſe of ſinning: when all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care is taken, to commit hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſinnes, as if it much imported our good. Sinnes, committed without ſhame and puniſhment, God paſſeth by often: but if with all our hearts and affections, our labour and diligence, we ſtriue to commit them, if we ſet vp our reſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid no ſinne that is, for our profit or pleaſure, that increaſeth the ſharpneſſe and haſtens the ſhortneſſe of our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What paines and diligence is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally vſed of al, to become more proud, more wanton, more rich, to be more the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4714:57"/>ſeruants of the fleſh and the diuell, then of God, the Theater of our world will ſpare me paines to ſpeake. But I will ſay it, and from the heart weepe it too, as that godly man did,<note place="margin">Anſelmus.</note> ſeeing a woman cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious about her perſon, to pleaſe her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, &amp; himſelfe not ſo diligent to pleaſe his God: O miſerable men, whom ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite loue, bleſſings, and riches, cannot prouoke to ſuch care and diligence of pleaſing God, as the vileſt things doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite our induſtrie to pleaſe the diuell.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The ſixt is, the pleaſure and glorie in ſinning, which is a degree higher then all the reſt. To take pleaſure, and boaſt of our iniquities, this is, to ſinne againſt God with a high hand. Of this <hi>Dauid, Pſal.</hi> 10. the vngodly boaſteth himſelfe in his owne hearts deſire: &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. cries out of ſuch wicked men: Why boaſteſt thou thy ſelfe thou canſt do euill? But ſinne was neuer ſo boaſted as now. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and men in their words, walkes, weeds proclaime the glorie of their ſinnes, &amp; are proud of nothing but their ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The ſeuenth is the perſeuerance of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: this, the higheſt ſtep of damnation and ruine. For hereby the moſt groſſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:4714:58"/>and odious ſinnes become inſenſible, and grow ſo little and light, we neyther ſee them nor feele them. How true is that of <hi>Gregory, Crimina diuturniora, ſunt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiora?</hi> Time doth not diminiſh ſinne, but increaſe it: if we ceaſe not to ſinne, God will neuer ceaſe to puniſh.

               <p>And that I may not ſeeme to ſpeake without booke, hauing no ſacred war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for it, this I put as a diuine, vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, poſitiue truth; that God neuer brought any generall or particular exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or ruine vpon any Kingdome, &amp;c. but theſe ſignes were the harbingers and fore-runners:<note place="margin">

If the fire of the ſacrifice, which (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeuentie yeares vnder the water of the Babylonian Captiuitie, was extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, when <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſolde the Prieſthood to <hi>Iaſon;</hi> thereby ſhewing vs, that the fierie power of the Holy Spirit left to worke in their Sacraments and Seruice, God abhorring all their Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Simonies ſake: what can wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, but that all our Prayers, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and Sacraments, ſhalbe turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſinne? ſeing ſo many <hi>Antiochiſſes,</hi> and <hi>Iaſons</hi> amongſt vs, that will buy and ſell ſacred things in deſpite of God.

               <p>Antiquitie, if we will looke into it ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, and beleeue it likewiſe, giues vs plaine euidences, that the moſt part of the greateſt Kingdomes haue not endured fiue hundred yeares.

The Kingdome of Iudah, from <hi>Saul</hi> to the captiuitie, dured but fiue hundred yeares. So after the Captiuitie, from <hi>Eſdras</hi> to the Emperour <hi>

               <p>Yet doe not Hiſtories here ſtaie their obſeruations, in reſpect of theſe fatall numbers, but doe diſcouer vnto vs, that the number of ſeuen hundred yeares haue brought no leſſe famous mutations to States and Kingdomes, then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: The Carthaginian Commonwealth hauing (when <hi>Scipio</hi> wholly ſubuerted it) continued ſeuen hundred yeares; The bloudie warre betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi> which was the conſumption of the Roman Empire, happening ſeuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Romes foundation.

               <p>I know the Learned doe in ſome ſort quarrel the neceſſitie of theſe periods of times for the fatal ruines of Empires; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome doe fall ſhort of theſe prefixed times, and ſome exceed them: But to cleare this doubt, I am of opinion, that the ground of this obſeruation hath no feebler warrant then the infallible Word of God: ſeeing we find there in <hi>Daniels</hi> ſeuentie weekes an vniuerſall Mappe of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:4714:69"/>the declining of Empires: which ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie weeks doe containe neere-hand fiue hundred yeares, from the reſtitution of the Temple, after the returne from the Babyloniſh captiuitie, vntil the comming of Chriſt in the fleſh. And albeit the ſaid period bee not vniuerſall and perpetuall, ſeeing many Kingdomes reach not to halfe that point; yet we ſhall finde by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall diſcourſe, that this Period hath not failed moſt Empires, as if by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment their beginnings and endings had beene written in the foreheads of theſe times. Which thing not onely the fore-alleaged examples, but many others which learned Antiquaries haue obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, doe clearely iuſtifie.

               <p n="1">1 Where firſt we muſt obſerue, That as all ſinne hath his riſe ſupernaturally from blindneſſe, ſo all our blindneſſe, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibilitie

               <p>Secondly, beſides thoſe ſeauen deadly ſinnes (as they call them) and others ariſing from them, there is another cauſe of our blindneſſe, and that is our defect of credulitie and beliefe. The eies of our ſoules (as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith) are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus &amp; affectus:</hi> Our vnderſtanding and affection.

                  <hi>Bernard</hi> ſath that Contemplation is a lifting vp of the minde, reſting vpon God, and taſting the ioyes of eternall ſweetneſſe.

For as by the eye of the bodie we ſee corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thinges: ſo by the minde, which is the eye of the ſoule, wee contemplate heauenly thinges: Therefore Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation is nothing but the viſion and ſight of the minde.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4714:100"/>deriued hence, becauſe it is a place deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to contemplation. For as wee ought in the Temple of God to recollect all our affections, cogitately to meditate and thinke vpon God, and his holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries and ordinances: ſo indeede this Contemplation, of which wee ſpeake, is nothing elſe but a true and perfect colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all our affections and powers of the ſoule to know ſomething with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and delight of minde concerning the nature of God; namely touching his power, his wiſedome, his goodneſſe, his loue, his nobilitie and bountie &amp;c. or touching the hidden iudgments of God, or his moſt holy will, or ſome other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent obiect, by which we bend and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our ſelues to God.</p>
               <p>Before wee come to handle the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and parts of Contemplation, we wil ſhew, Firſt, the difference betwixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, Meditation, and Cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, the inducements to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation. Thirdly, the arguments and tokens of true Contemplation. Fourthly, the impediments of contemplation. Firſt, The difference is, in that wee ſhall finde in Cogitation there is an evagation and wandring of the minde; in Meditation,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:4714:100"/>an inveſtigation of the minde; but in Contemplation, and Admiration of the mind. Cogitation is without labour, and without fruit; Meditation is with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and with profit; Contemplation is without labour and with profit.<note place="margin">Greg. lib. <hi>2.</hi> in Ezech. Hom. <hi>17</hi>
                  </note> Secondly, Thoſe three degrees of which <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſpeaketh, ought to induce vs to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of God. Firſt, That the ſoule collect it ſelfe to it ſelfe. Secondly, That being collected, it may ſee what an one it is. Thirdly, That it riſe aboue it ſelfe, and doe ſubiect it ſelfe, intending to the contemplation of the inviſible Authour of it ſelfe. But it cannot collect it ſelfe to it ſelfe by no meanes, except firſt it learne to driue from the eye of the minde, all fancies of Earthly or Heauenly formes; and to deſpiſe and tread vnder foot what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer occurres the Cogitation, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the corporeall eye, eare, ſmell, taſt, or touch, in as much as he ſeeks himſelfe to be ſuch within, as he is without theſe. For when he thinkes of theſe thinges, he doth within himſelfe (as it were) handle certaine ſhadowes of bodies. Therefore all theſe by the hand of Diſcretion are to bee driuen from the eye of the minde as much as may bee, in as much as the ſoule
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4714:101"/>conſiders it ſelfe to be ſuch, as it was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder God aboue the bodie. Beſides, the ineffable ſweetneſſe which is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation perceiued; the admirable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which is there learned; and the beginning of nil happineſſe which is there found; ought to induce vs therevn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For there the moſt high GOD, the fountaine of all happineſſe, is knowne; and that which is knowne, is belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and that which is beloued is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and laboured for; and that which is carefully laboured for, is acquired; and when it is at length acquired,<note place="margin">Ber in Ser. <hi>35.</hi> in Can.</note> it is with interminable and endleſſe delight poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: ſuch delight, as that <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, That the ſoule which hath once learned and receiued of God to enter into it ſelfe, and in his very inwards to long for the preſence of God, &amp; euer to ſeek his face; (for God is a ſpirit, and thoſe that ſeeke him, the muſt walke in the ſpirit, and not hue after the fleſh) ſuch a ſoule (I ſay) I know not whether it account it more horrible and painefull to ſuffer Hell it ſelfe for a time, then after the ſweetneſſe of this ſpirituall ſtudie once taſted, to goe out againe to the pleaſures, or rather the grieuances of fleſh, and to ſeeke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the inſatiable curioſitie of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes:

                  <hi>The eye is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with ſeing, nor the Eare with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> Behold a man well experienced; Thou art good (Oh Lord) to them that hope in thee, to the ſoule that ſeeks thee. If any man labour to turne his ſoule from this good, I ſuppoſe hee will iudge it no other, then if hee ſaw himſelfe thruſt out of Paradiſe, and from entrance into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. This is the ſame <hi>Dauid</hi> that anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Lord, bidding him ſeeke his face, <hi>Thy face, Lord, will I ſeeke.</hi> Therefore nothing is ſo much to bee feared of him, that hath once receiued this benefit, as that being relinquiſhed of that grace, he be againe inforced to goe out to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations of the fleſh, nay rather the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, and againe to ſuffer the tumults of the carnall ſenſes. In this Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>Augustine,</hi> when he ſaid, That whatſoeuer he did in the World diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him. Thirdly, The tokens of true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, is, to loath any longer to liue in the miſerie of this World:<note place="margin">

Fourthly, The impediments of Contemplation. As in the eye of the bodie three thinges doe hinder the ſight of if; ſo there are three which doe hinder the ſight of the eye of the mind. The bodily eye may be ſound, yet if it want the outward light, it ſees nothing. It may alſo haue the light pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and yet ſome bloud or humour fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into it, it may hinder the ſight of it. It may alſo fall out, that neither of thoſe, I ſay, neither light nor health may bee wanting; yet ſome duſt may fall into the eye, that may dull the ſight. Therefore, theſe three, Darkneſſe, Humor, and Duſt, hinder the ſight of the bodie. Theſe things are the ſame by which the inward ſight is hindred; but they borrow other names, For that which is here called Darkneſſe, is there called Sin; that which is here called a Humour, is there called the confluence of the ſweetneſſe of ſins, running into our me more, as into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſinke; and that which is here called
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4714:102"/>Duſt, is there called Care of Earthly things. Theſe three confound the eye of the vnderſtanding, &amp; exclude it from the Contemplation of the true Light: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Darkeneſſe of ſinnes, the pleaſing recordation of ſinnes, and the care of Earthly buſines. With theſe three diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes King <hi>Dauid</hi> complained he was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Firſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.</note> 
                  <hi>The light of my eyes is not with me.</hi> Secondly, <hi>My bones conſume through my daily complaining.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>I eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes in ſtead of bread</hi> the aſhes of Action for the bread of Contemplation, as <hi>Hierome</hi> expounds it. Therefore whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer directs the eye of his minde to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Contemplation, hee muſt labour to acquite himſelfe of theſe impediments. Againſt a threefolde diſeaſe, a threefolde remedie muſt bee had. The firſt is healed by repentance; the ſecond by prayer; the third by holy exerciſes, after the example of <hi>Marie,</hi> who choſe the one thing that was neceſſarie, ſitting at Ieſus his feete and hearing his preaching.</p>
               <p>Now the parts of Contemplation may be reduced to theſe three conſiderations: the firſt appertayning to God; the ſecond to man; he third to the compariſon of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thinges with inviſible.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:4714:103"/>1 Of this part which appertaines to God are foure branches. The firſt of them is the admiration of the Diuine Maieſtie; that is to ſay, that God is one in eſſence, and three in perſons; that hee is the Father begetting; the Sonne begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from the Father and the Some; and that, before all times, and from all eternitie. For neither the Father beganue to beget; nor the Sonne beganne to bee borne; nor the Holy Ghoſt beganne to proceed: but the Father begetting was from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; and the Some begotten was from euerlaſting; and the Holy Ghoſt procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was from euerlaſting: three perſons and one God. The Father, God alone; the Sonne, God alone; the Holy Ghoſt, God alone: becauſe in the Father is the whole eſſentiall perfection of the Deitie; and in the Sonne is the whole eſſentiall perfection of the Deitie; and in the Holy Ghoſt is the whole eſſentiall perfection of the Deitie: not mult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> the breadth of GOD, that is, his Charitie. Thirdly. his heighth, that is his power. Fourthly, his depth, that is his wiſdome. His length, that hath no limit of place or time: his breadth, that hath no bounds of men nor Creatures,<note place="margin">

So is hee Length, for his eternitie; Breadth for his charitie; Heighth, for his Maieſtic; and Depth for his wiſedome. Oh moſt wiſe Maieſtie, and Maieſticall Wiſedome! Oh moſt louing Eternitie, and Eternall Charitie!</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond, is the conſideration of the workes of God, that is to ſay of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:4714:104"/>Creation, Reparation, and Gubernati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In the Creation, his wiſdome, power and goodneſſe is to bee admired. In the Reparation, his Wiſedome, Power, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and mercie. In the Gubernation, his truth, wiſedome, iuſtice, mercie, and power.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third, is the admiration of the iudgements of God; whereof ſome are euident and ſome hidden. Thoſe reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, know, and by no meanes decline from them. The hidden, becauſe they are too deep, adore and reuerence.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth, is the recordation and calling to minde of the promiſed happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and future life: and on the other ſide, of the endleſſe puniſhments of them that receiue not Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Of theſe partes the firſt will inuite vs to the Reuerence and Feare of God: the ſecond, to Loue: the third, to Humilitie; and the fourth, to Faith, Hope, Patience; and all of them together will inuite vs to thankeſgiuing, by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond member of Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, concerning Man himſelfe: which that moſt famous Apothegme and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence commends to vs, <hi>Noſce te ipſum,</hi> Know thy ſelfe; which is the one halfe of

Hence <hi>Auguſtine</hi> deſired no more of God, but <hi>Nouerim me, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerime te,</hi> That I may know my ſelfe, and know thee. This part, in reſpect of diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of States of men, muſt be diſtributed into foure orders or degrees. Of which the firſt, is the ſtate of the firſt Man, which is called the ſtate of Innocencie. Of this ſtate it is inquired, of whom thou art created? Of GOD. Where? in the Earthly Paradiſe. Whence? from the ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me of the Earth, and breath of God. What kinde? deſirous of rule, reaſonable, and of free will and power in himſelfe. How? in the Image of God, Iuſt, Holy, True, ioyned to God. To what? to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. For what? to worſhip God: of which thing the forme of Man doth admoniſh vs; for thither is the minde to be directed, whither the countenance is erected. The ſecond, is the ſtate of the ſecond Man, which is truely called the ſtate of Miſerie. <hi>Adam</hi> hauing fallen from God, begat ſuch as himſelfe was by his fall, that is to ſay, miſerable, impure, vniuſt, damned. Euery one that is borne, as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith, is borne <hi>Adam,</hi> that is to ſay, damned, of one damned. The third, is the ſtate of the third Man;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4714:105"/>in which Man being fallen is lift vp by the hand of God, that is, by Chriſt, who being apprehended by faith, reformes, iuſtifies, and ſanctifies Man: and this is rightly called the ſtate of grace. Of this ſtate preacheth the Goſpell of Chriſt. The fourth, is the ſtate of the fourth Man, that is of perfect happineſſe, in which wee ſhalbee like vnto Chriſt for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Of theſe parts, the firſt commends many thinges to bee contemplated, but chiefly the nobilitie and dignitie of Man, created in the Image of God, that hee might worſhip and celebrate God. The ſecond admoniſheth vs of the miſerie of Man, to be deplored, into which hee fell by his owne default and will. The third commends t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> vs the mercie of God, and vnſpeakeable loue of the Sonne of God, to be meditated with faith and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing. The fourth ſtirres vp a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gladneſſe and comfort in the mindes of the godly from the hope of promiſed ſaluation, with thankeſgiuing, and care of godly liuing.</p>
               <p>The third member, is of the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thinges viſible and inviſible. And how ſweet this contemplation is, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring viſible thinges to inviſible, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:4714:105"/>and ſpirituall thinges, no man can ſufficiently expreſſe. For ſo hath GOD that moſt wiſe Architect framed theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thinges, that Man being put as the Contemplator and beholder in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of them, hee might lead him, as by the hand, into the knowledge of things inviſible, Heauenly, and ſpirituall. In which thing, the moſt high wiſedome, goodneſſe, power, and Maieſtie of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker is with admiration beholden, and this to that end, that he might be ackno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, glorified, and worſhipped of Man whome hee created to happineſſe. This Contemplation our LORD com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to vs with diuers Parables in the Hiſtorie of the Goſpell, ſignifying not obſcurely; That there is nothing viſible created of GOD, which hath not ſome compariſon to inviſible thinges, namely, either to frame aright the manners of men, or to contemplate Heauenly and Spirituall things; inſomuch that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer ſenſible thinges are framed by God, are (as it were) certaine Symboles and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of ſome thinges, that are not expoſed to our ſenſes. To make this more plaine: The fire which wee ſee, is (as it were) a Symbole and reſemblance
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:4714:106"/>of the Holy Spirit. For as the fire burnes, inſightens, and purgeth; ſo the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit inflames the heartes, inſightens the minde with the true light, and purgeth vices. This glorious Sunne; is it not (as it were) the Symbole and repreſentation, not onely of the humane nature, aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Sonne of God into an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall Vnion, but alſo of the preſence of Chriſt, and his efficacie in the Church? Beſides, the nature of things it ſelfe is to vs (as it were) a Schoolemaſter, chiefly to the vnderſtanding of the Myſteries of Holy Scriptures. What ſhall I ſay of the Figures of the olde Teſtament, by which the things of the new Teſtament are ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed? What meaneth the prohibition of the eating of certaine beaſtes? was it not for the auoiding of certaine proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of theirs, vnto them good in their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but to vs hurtful in the degree of our Dignitie? What ſhall I ſay of the Types of the olde Couenant and Teſtament, by which Heauenly, Spirituall, and eternall thinges, were ſignified, offered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued? In the writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, Apoſtles, and Fathers, many ſuch things are recounted; ſo that I need not waſte time in giuing you any further
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:4714:106"/>taſt heereof; but conclude this point with <hi>Senecas</hi> iudgement: <hi>Quicquid vides, &amp; quicquid nòn vides, Deus est;</hi> Whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou ſeeſt, and what o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If then contemplation be that moſt excellent action of the moſt excellent part, the minde; and touching the moſt excellent ſubiect, God himſelfe; How can it be but moſt fit for the moſt excellent perſons, Kings and Princes?</p>
               <p>But amongſt all vertues, illuſtrious perſons, and ſuch as are ſet in the higheſt places in this world, ſeeme to haue a greater inclination to one more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and regall then the reſt: and that is Magnanimitie: whoſe nature is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to caſt downe himſelfe to abiect things, but to performe and procure the greateſt things; of which kinde are true and great honours, which is the proper worke alſo of contemplation, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not for baſe and contemptible things, but for true honours, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, and the vnſpeakable glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thereof. Whence it doth manifeſtly follow, that ſeeing nothing in this world is more abiect then ſinne, nor any thing of more excellency and magnanimitie, then vertue; Princes and great ones are much to bee blamed, if they ſuffer themſelues to be ouercome of any ſinne, or doe depart from the more noble life
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4714:111"/>of vertues and contemplation. Yet it is to be obſerued, that this vertue of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie is in this world mightily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured, and troden vnder foote, by the blindneſſe of men. For albeit many are by nature magnanimous, yet becauſe they make great account of the proſperities and honours of this world, forgetting the more ſublime and excellent honour of vertue it ſelfe, and chiefely of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which conſiſts in this, That a man doe vanquiſh himſelfe: and alſo forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that moſt high reward, which in heauen is prepared for them that giue themſelues to a ſpirituall life: Thus whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they magnifie the things of this world, and are with all their hearts and ſtrength occupied in them, they diſeſteem that in which true Magnanimitie conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, namely Vertue, and the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of heauenly things. And they hence take a pretext and colour of this their complacency &amp; worldly comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from the common vſe and practiſe of this kinde of life, amongſt the moſt high and noble perſons, who (for the moſt part) ire beſotted with theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunarie, and baſe fooleries: nor in the meane time doe they obſerue, that the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:4714:112"/>truly-wiſe do laugh them to ſcorne; euen as thoſe moſt high celeſtiall Princes, and all the Courtiers of his Court, the leaſt of whom hath a greater regall pompe then al the <hi>Caeſars</hi> Courts of this brittle world, which onely is (as it were) but a little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and yet doth ſo delude their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.</p>
               <p>From this will manifeſtly ariſe thus much: That in very deed they are moſt abiect and vnworthie of honour, albeit they are held for great in this world, who doe not exerciſe all their powers in the ſpirituall life, and ſeruice of the moſt high King and God, from whom onely they may obtaine thoſe ſo excellent benefits, which in heart they ſo much deſire. It is alſo euident, that Princes and great ones haue a greater Obligation to this vertue of Magnanimitie, and to all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the ſame: and therefore it may truly be ſaid, that for this Obligation and Magnanimitie, all doctrine which concernes a ſpirituall life, doth more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine to them then to others, whoſe puſillanimitie and weakneſſe of minde, doth not lift vp themſelues to deſire and procure ſo difficult and great matters. Surely, if it be a baſe thing for Princes and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4714:112"/>Great ones to be exerciſed in gatheting vp the ſmall crummes of Sugar, that fall from the ballance: much more abiect and baſe it is to place the minde in the vaine ſweetneſſe of delights, and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of this world, ſeeing hence doth follow not onely obliuion, but alſo the perdition of the moſt high honour and glory, for the which was giuen them that great and generous minde they haue, and that mightie power, and great place they hold. Of all theſe things, that moſt glorious King of the vniuerſall, heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and earthly Court, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, hath giuen a moſt, cleare example, who offered his moſt regall perſon to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable iniuries and afflictions for thoſe wonderfull things of heauen; who for the ioy that was ſet before him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Croſſe, deſpiſed the ſhame,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10.6.</note> deſpiſed the Kingdomes of this world, when they were offered him.</p>
               <p>Surely, I know not by what title or right he will call himſelfe an illuſtrious Lord in this world, who ſpends his life in acquiring the honours of this world,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4714:113"/>ſeeing he may behold his King to deſire death, whereby to ſet him free from the vaine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I know not how he dare number himſelfe amongſt great and excellent men, who lets fall his heart vpon things ſo abiect and baſe, ſeeing in very truth that abiect things are farre diſtant and vnfit for ſublime, great, and generous ſpirits.</p>
               <p>This Magnanimitie ought ſingularly to induce Noble and Heroicke perſons neuer to commit ſinne, ſeeing ſinne is the moſt abiect &amp; vile thing in this world, in reſpect that it is aduerſant to the fidelitie they owe to God, and vilifieth them in the ſight of God and all good men. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no tongue nor hand of another man can ſo affect vs with any iniurie, as our owne ſinnes doe defile and ſhame vs, which we daily commit before God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom we are euer preſent. This Magnanimitie alſo muſt haue this effect in great ones; not to feele any aduerſitie, from whomſoeuer it come: ſeeing it cannot hurt a wiſe man any further then he will in his minde eſtimate it. But a true &amp; magnanimous eſteemer of things,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:4714:113"/>doth not reckon any thing for any great euill, which doth not concerne the ſoule: for all the reſt, where that is had, muſt be committed to obliuion; and where that hath paſt away, it muſt no more moue vs, then that which for the vilitie of it deſerues to be committed to forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. Vnto all theſe things which I haue ſpoken, great men and Rulers ought to inuite and moue their ſubiects by all poſſible meanes; and that for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons: Firſt, for that the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, did ſo. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for that chiefely, euen for this cauſe, principalitie and power is giuen vnto them in the earth, ſeeing all good gouernment is to this end diſpoſed of God, vnto which good gouernement they ſtand obliged. Thirdly, for that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great men is due a great and excellent ſocietie, which cannot bee, vnleſſe their people be godly and vertuous. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, amongſt all men, vertue and good life is moſt glorious: which things (of a ſuretie) no Preacher can with ſo great facilitie, and ſuch felicitie, plant in any Region or Kingdome, as thoſe that gouerne it, if they would marke and do the things wee houe declared: and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:4714:114"/>thoſe that will not ſo doe, but thinke that the ſtudie of vertue, religion, and contemplation, are vnſutable for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and great perſons, I may ſay as the bleſſed Apoſtle ſaith, That they are worſe then Infidels. For as the ſoule and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life is by ſo much more louely, by how much the whole world with the riches thereof is to be preferred before a basket of dung, as our Lord taught vs, who led a life full of calamities, and died a death full of ſorrowes and ignominies; teaching vs to liue a ſpirituall life, and little to eſteeme of this corporall: ſo thoſe that are greateſt amongſt men, ought to chuſe, and bee exerciſed in, the greateſt and beſt things, that is, in conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſpirituall and heauenly life, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning the vaine glory of this world, as a thing moſt vnworthie of a generous and magnanimous ſpirit.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:4714:115"/>thinges which nouriſh ſlouth, and ſtirre vp young men to the deſire of pleaſure. Strength, confirmed with prudence, may profit without which it brings more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoditie to him that hath it: and as it adornes the bodies of them exerciſed, ſo it caſts a darkneſſe vpon the induſtrie of the minde. On the other ſide, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of vertue, in whoſe mindes ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it ſhall incorruptly grow vp, doth onely waxe olde, being both more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then riches, and more profitable then the ſplendour of Birth; making ſuch thinges eaſie, as others cannot attaine; ſtoutly ſuſtaining thinges fearefull to the multitude, accounting ſlouth for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, but labour for an high praiſe.</p>
               <p>This thing it is eaſie to learne from the labours of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and geſtes of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> to whoſe workes that excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of manners added ſuch an illuſtrious note of glorie, that not all the paſſages of Worlds ſhall euer bee able to oblite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate their famous Actes.</p>
               <p>For indeed, if thou calleſt to mind thy Fathers indeuours, thou ſhalt haue a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticke and ſingular example of thoſe thinges which I ſpeake of: for ſo he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his life, that hee made no ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:4714:116"/>of Vertue, nor waxed dull with ſlouth, but both accuſtomed his bodie to labours, and tamed and ouercame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with his minde. The ſame did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aboue meaſure loue riches, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed the preſent good thinges, as a mortall man; againe, as not obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the chance of Death, neglected not thinges gotten; nor ledde his life ſordidely, but was both Honourable and Magnificall, and alſo to his friendes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and inlarged. Thoſe alſo that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the ſtudie of Letters hee more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and loued then thoſe of kinne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: ſuppoſing that to the coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of minds Nature was more powerfull then Law, manners then kinred, the choice of life then neceſſitie. And ſo, to number all his actions ſcarce one whole life would ſuffice: of which yet in a more conuenient time wee will reſolue a more exact narration.</p>
               <p>Now at the leaſt wee haue delineated <hi>Hipponicus</hi> his nature howſoeuer, that thou maiſt haue whereby to compoſe thy life, as after an example, whileſt thou haſt his manner inſtead of a Law, and ſhalt labor to imitate and aemulate thy Fathers Vertues. For it ſhalbe a diſhoneſt thing,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4714:116"/>when Painters take euerie excellent beaſt to expreſſe to themſelues, that yong men in like manner ſhould not imitate their moſt excellent Parents. I would haue thee perſwade thy ſelfe, that it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becomes Champions better, to prepare themſelues againſt their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; then thou ſhouldeſt take care, that in the ſame inſtitute of life with thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thou labour with like praiſe.</p>
               <p>But yet he cannot be ſo affected in his minde, who ſhall not bee furniſhed with various and thoſe moſt excellent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. For as by moderate labour the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die increaſeth; ſo by Nature it is alſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that the minde by ſpeeches of good profit, ſhould grow vp. Therefore I will endeuour to ſet before thy eyes compendiouſly, by what way chiefly (in my opinion) thou muſt trauaile to attaine Vertue, and approue thy ſelfe vnto other mortall men.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Therefore obſerue thou religiouſly the thinges that belong to God, aſwell in ſacrificing, as in keeping thy oath: That is a token of the abundance of thy riches; this an argument of thy honeſtie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>

               <p n="20">20 Whatſoeuer leiſure thou ſhalt haue in thy life, beſtowe it in hearing of precepts: for by this meanes thou ſhalt not difficultly learne thoſe things, which with great labour haue beene excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and invented by others.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Conceiue that many documents are more worth then great riches: for theſe quickly waſte, but thoſe laſt for all times. For Wiſedome onely before other poſſeſſions eſcapes mortalitie.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Doubt not to take, though a long iourney, to Maſters that profeſſe to teach any profitable thing: for where Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants paſſe ſo many and vaſt Seas to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their little ſubſtance gotten; ſhall it not bee a filthie thing, if a young man neglect to trauaile an earthly iourney, to the end to beautifie his minde?</p>

Surely, fatall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie hath propoſed to all men once to die: but honeſtly to depart from this life is from Nature granted vnto good men by a certaine priuiledge.</p>

The vſe whereof as thou maiſt eaſily learne, yet thou ſhalt hardly finde ſuch, as from the heart will ſo counſaile thee. Therefore leaſt thou ſhouldeſt deſire the reſt of ſome other
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:4714:124"/>men, but mighteſt from hence as from a ſtorehouſe draw them; I haue thought it my dutie to omit nothing, whereby I might giue thee counſaile. Surely I ſhall think I haue receiued a great fauour from God, if I faile not of that opinion, I haue conceiued of thee. For euen as wee ſee many more affected with dainties, then wholeſome meats: ſo there are that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apply themſelues to their friends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the ſame contagion of vices, then to ſuch as doe rightly admoniſh them. In which things thou doeſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeme to mee, to be affected after a contrarie manner, by an argument of thy induſtry which thou haſt adhibited in the reſt of thy inſtitution. For he that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to himſelfe to do the beſt things, it is very likely he will not deſpiſe thoſe that exhort him to vertue.</p>
               <p>And chiefely thou ſhalt be enkindled to deſire vertue and honeſtie, if thou ſhalt learne, that moſt truly at the length wee haue thoſe pleaſures which theſe doe bring forth. For in ſloth, is deſire of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitation, &amp; gluttonie: there is griefe together ioyned with pleaſure; but the labour and moderate inſtitution of life, that is placed in acquiring vertue, brings vnto vs ſincere and double permanent
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:4714:124"/>oblectation: and there we firſt feele the pleaſure, and after are ſorie, but heere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the labour, we enioy the ſenſe of pleaſure. Beſides, in euery the ſenſe of pleaſure. Beſides, in euery thing we are not ſo mindful of the beginning, as we are affected with the ſenſe of the end; for many things, that fal out in our liues, we take not in hand for the things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, but for the fruite we hope from thence.</p>
               <p>Call to minde the crue of the wicked, who are not wont to doe but obliuious things, and of no moment, as (forſooth) hauing choſen this kinde of life to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the beginning. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, Vertue cannot bee neglected of good men, except they will incurre the reprehenſions of many. For all men doe no otherwiſe hate the openly delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, then thoſe that doe belie inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie of life: in the meane time not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the vulgar; and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe. For where we reiect thoſe that do but lie in their words, ſhal we not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them to be euill, that in their whole life are altogether aberra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t? Surely, we will ſay, that ſuch men by good right are not onely delinquent againſt themſelues, but euen traytours of their owne fortune, as that which hath betraid (as it were) in their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4714:125"/>hands, riches, eſtimation, and friends: and themſelues vnworthie of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent felicitie.</p>
               <p>And if it be lawfull for a mortall man to ſearch into the minde of the Gods, I ſuppoſe they would make plaine in their owne children, how they are affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the wicked and the good. <hi>Iupiter,</hi> who begot <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Tantalus</hi> (as fables ſpeake and is the conſtant opinion of all men) indued the one with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie for his vertues, and afflicted the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with moſt grieuous puniſhments for his ſinnes. By which examples we ought to be inflamed to couet honeſtie, and ſo not onely to inſiſt vpon the things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue ſpoken, but alſo to learne all the beſt ſentences of Poets, and to marke the ſayings of other wiſe men, if they haue ſpoken any thing profitably. For as the Bee ſits on all flowres (as we ſee) drawing profitable things from euerie one: ſo whoſoeuer affects learning, ought to bee ignorant of nothing, but euery where gather that may profit him: for euen ſcarce by this diligence ſhall hee ouercome the errours of Nature.</p>

                  <p n="6">6 The Prince doth chiefly experience his Subiects minds, and bindes them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by beneficence.</p>

                  <p n="10">10 Vnder a good Prince, it is lawfull for euery man to retaine, and ſafely to keepe their owne thinges, albeit they be magnificall, opulent, and rich:</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Tyrants, by how much more pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for their true vertues, by ſo much doe thinke their vices vpbraided, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelues ſcorned: whence they grow angrie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is the Tyrants cuſtome to hate thoſe, whom the people or Senate as wel deſeruing of him commends and loues.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is more ſafe for euerie noble and great man, to haue a Tyrant angrie with him, then flattering and propitious, viz. diſſembling.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is the Tyrants cuſtome whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any Subiect hath that is good, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and beautifull, whether it bee in thinges of the ſoile or of his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per right, to occuple and retaine to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The onely crime of treaſon, is the ſingular crime of them, without fault: for by this pretext, euen the beſt men are ouerthrowne of their ſeruants.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Euen thoſe that make wicked Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doe themſelues hate wicked Princes,</p>

                  <p n="9">9 In the thinges that are wel done by an ill Prince, not the thing or deed, but the Authour of the fact diſpleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 All the whole Age of proud Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is but ſhort, and ſubiect to various dangers.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude all: who ſhall not take profit by the many ſweete inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which this Booke tendreth him, may iuſtly with hearts griefe Complaine as euery vn-fortunate Courtier doth. Whoſe ſorrow I feelingly thus expreſſe.</p>
